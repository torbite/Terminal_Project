# Terminal_Project

This project was just a fun challenge that I decided to do.
these are the possible commands to use:

- `ls` -> List files in directory
- `cd` -> Open a directory
- `mkdir` -> Create a directory
- `pwd` -> Show path to current directory
- `touch` -> Create files
- `cat` -> Read files
- `echo` -> Edit files
- `python` -> Execute python files

Fell free to run the `terminal.py` file and have a virtual mac terminal to use!
